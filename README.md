# gameScoring
The grand idea is to make this a scoring app for most table top games that have "complicated" scoring. That is, any game that requires tracking groups to square the totals of unique groups, or that have multipliers of different game elements.  This started with Stone Age as it's a game we play frequently and has this kind of scoring mechanism.
